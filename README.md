# OutRun Watch App

OutRun is an existing iOS application. This application is an Outdoor Fitness Tracker that records any type of physical movement which includes 
walking, running, cycling, and skating.

This repo uses the open source code of the OutRun Application which can be found through the link below:

This source code is used as a reference to create a WatchOS version of the application. It includes the main feature of recording your outdoor fitness
of the day alongside some additional features unique to the WatchOS only.
